# Airplay for Homey

Airplay for Homey adds airplay functionality to your flows. From now on you can start a radio stream, watch a youtube video or any other supported video format on your apple tv!

Create a flow for when you get home and let homey asks you to play some radio on your apple tv. Or maybe even play some awesome warning video when your alarm goes off.

Currently only the video api is integrated. This means that when playing radio, you will get a black screen.

**If you like this app, then consider to buy me a beer :)**
